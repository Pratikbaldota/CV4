Sure, here are the steps to implement the Factorization method for SfM in Python:

    Load the images and convert them to grayscale.
    Detect features in the first image using a feature detection algorithm such as SIFT or Harris corner detection.
    Track the detected features in subsequent frames using a feature tracking algorithm such as KLT or Lucas-Kanade.
    Filter out any outliers in the feature tracks using RANSAC or a similar algorithm.
    Estimate the camera motion between frames using the filtered feature tracks and the known camera intrinsics.
    Triangulate the 3D positions of the feature points using the estimated camera motion.
    Refine the estimated 3D positions of the feature points using bundle adjustment.
    Write the 3D coordinates of the triangulated points to a PLY file in ASCII format.
